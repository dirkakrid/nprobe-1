1. bgp_probe_client.pl
   BGP lister written in perl: your BGP-enabled router connects to it, and it injects in a local
   nProbe instance all the routes (initially all received routes, later all the routing updates)
   so that the probe can compute the AS path and put it into emitted flows.

   NOTE that you need to configure into the source code your AS info

2. readBgpDump.py 
   Tool that loads BGP tables from the RIPE BGP RIS project (http://www.ripe.net/ris/, http://data.ris.ripe.net)
